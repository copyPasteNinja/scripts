  <h1>Hi, I'm CopyPasteNinja</h1>
  <p>
    A DevOps, Backend, and Software Engineer—driven by curiosity and a little bit of coffee.<br>
    I enjoy building scalable systems, automating processes, and simplifying complex workflows.

    <h2>Side Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently building a portfolio app integrated with LLM models to answer questions<br>
      based entirely on the content of my portfolio and personal background.<br>
      It's hosted in AWS using <strong>HappyFace</strong> and native Bedrock services.<br>
      A blend of tech, AI, and infrastructure—tailored to tell my story.

    <h2>Life Outside the Terminal</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not writing code, I'm out in nature—tending my vegetable garden<br>
      or caring for my backyard chickens. I find peace in slow living and green spaces.<br><br>
      I'm also passionate about clean energy. I've built a solar-powered shed using 4 panels<br>
      that now run my tools and lights—proving that good engineering starts at home.
